# Capital-Cities
This project contains my personal solution to the challenges of project 16 of hacking with swift.

#Challenges:
- Try typecasting the return value from dequeueReusableAnnotationView() so that it's an MKPinAnnotationView. Once thatâ€™s done, change the pinTintColor property to your favorite UIColor.
- Add a UIAlertController that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a mapType property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, .satellite gives a satellite view of the terrain.
- Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.
